Python bindings to libretro API, implemented in Cython.
Attempting to match the old python-snes API as closely as possible.
The code here is currently far from organized or complete, but is usable.

To build the libraries, run:
	python2 setup.py build_ext

Currently, the code works for some cores and segfaults on others.
Known to work with: fceu, gambatte, snes9x
Known NOT to work with: bnes, bsnes, genplus, meteor, vba
